        Good one Nuget <br>
        Ribbit VPN has been officially closed due to a completely real DMCA Takedown by <b>Nuget</b>.
      </p>

      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        Our Military Grade Protection was too much for <i>SOMEONE</i> to handle. Due to our lack of resources we could not fight back and had no chance but to close.
      </p>

      <h2>What now?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No more downloads.</li>
        <li>No more lifetime access.</li>
        <li>Support ends 11/08/25.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you still have the Ribbit VPN client installed... you are lying.
