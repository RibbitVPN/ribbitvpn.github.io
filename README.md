# Building app from source
If you want the app clone the repo yourself and build it yourself I aint going to build and upload binaries for linux and bimbows too

If you can't build the app, then its a skill issue 💀.
Read [Building.md](https://github.com/RibbitVPN/ribbitvpn.github.io/blob/main/Building.md) ig.
